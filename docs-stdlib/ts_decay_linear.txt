[Operator specifiation for ts_decay_linear]
1. Type signature
ts_decay_linear: Signal<Float> (signal: Signal<Float>, period: Signal<Float> or Int)
2. Arguments
signal: Unsmoothed input signal.
period: Smoothing window. Positive value. Dynamic window is used when the type of period is a Signal. 
3. Semantic Definition 
Apply moving average to the input signal by averaging adjacent datapoints, with linearly decaying weight.
Convolution of triangular kernel to the time series.
Reduces turnover.
4. Example
accumulation = ts_decay_linear(signal=money_flow, period=14)
