[Operator specifiation for ts_decay_exp]
1. Type signature
ts_decay_exp: Signal<Float> (signal: Signal<Float>, period: Either(Signal<Float>,Int))
2. Arguments
signal: Unsmoothed input signal.
period: Smoothing window. Positive value. Dynamic window is used when the type of period is a Signal. 
3. Semantic Definition 
Apply moving average to the input signal by averaging adjacent datapoints, with exponentially decaying weight.
Convolution of exponential kernel to the time series. Weight is decayed from 1 to e^{-3} \sim 0.082.
Reduces turnover.
4. Example
accumulation = ts_decay_exp(signal=money_flow, period=63)
